Python-3.4-Utilities
====================
<br />
A list of Python 3.4 command line utilities, such as a file extension replacer and an audio converter. All files are heavily commented, so it shouldn't be too hard to read and understand.
<br />
Currently, Python Utilities consists of the following modules:
<br />
+ An audio converter
+ A file extension replacer.

<br />
Planned features:
<br />
+ Add Docstring to each module.

<br />
To use these modules, run them from a Terminal like so: "python module_name.py". Make sure your Python version is >= 3.X.X, though it has only been tested with 3.4.1.
<br />
<br />
Have fun, and I hope you find these modules useful!
